# MAD20-StashBusters

StashBusters is a social, collaborative, and eco-conscious app where users share photos of their craft supply stashes – fabric, yarn, beads, paper, etc. – and swap supplies and ideas for using them, boosting creativity and keeping craft materials out of landfills.

**Target Users**
- Crafters, ages 18-35.
- Crafters that have too many craft materials lying around and/or crafters that want to inspire other crafters to creatively use craft materials they have lying around.
- Eco-conscious individuals that believe we should try to use what we already have instead of going out to buy new supplies.
- Any kind of crafter-- knitters, crocheters, sewists, jewelry-maker, woodworking, upcycler, thrift-flipper etc.

**Collaborators**
- Zee Nguyen
